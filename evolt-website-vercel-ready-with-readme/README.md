# Evolt Website - Vercel Deployment

This is a ready-to-upload ZIP for **Vercel static hosting**.

## What's Included
- All site files (HTML, CSS, JS, assets)
- `vercel.json` to route all paths to `index.html` (fixes 404 errors)
- `.git/` folder removed (not needed for deployment)

## How to Deploy
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard).
2. Click **"Add New..." → "Project" → "Import"**.
3. Select **"Deploy from ZIP"**.
4. Upload this ZIP (`evolt-website-vercel-ready.zip`).
5. Wait for deployment to finish — your site should now work for all routes.

No additional configuration or build commands are required.
